## FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification: Tribute Page project
### Margaret Hamilton Tribute Page


#### Description
This is my first coding project as well as my first repository.  
For now, most of this repository will be empty as I'm still working on the page but still need to host files on Github.  
The files and this readme will be updated soon.  


#### FreeCodeCamp
[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a non-profit-organization founded by Quincy Larson launched in 2014.  
It's an amazing free resource for both experience coders and beginners. They offer a wide range of tools, from articles to interactive coding challenges.  
The best part about FreeCodeCamp is that their curriculum is self-paced and easy to understand.  
The languages and technologies currently taught are HTML5, PHP, CSS 3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, React.js, Node.js, Python, Express.js, MongoDB, and Git.
